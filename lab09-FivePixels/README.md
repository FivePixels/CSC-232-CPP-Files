# Lab09 - Sort Algorithms Complexity Analysis

In this lab we investigate the run-time and spacial complexity of several common sorting algorithms.

## Background

Background reading for this lab includes

* Chapter 10 - Algorithm Efficiency
* Chapter 11 - Sorting Algorithms and Their Efficiency

## Objective

Upon successful completion of this lab, the student shall gain an understanding of 
* the difference between run-time and spacial complexity
* the use of Big-O notation used to describe these complexities
* various common sorting algorithms and their run-time and spacial complexities in the following scenarios
  * best case
  * average case
  * worst case

### Due Date

Your Teams submission is due by 11:59 PM, Friday, October 30, 2020.

### Grading Rubric

This assignment is worth **3 points**. Points earned are contingent on the fraction of correct information found in the submitted document.

### Late Penalty

* In the first 24 hour period following the due date, this lab will be penalized 0.6 point meaning the grading starts at 2.4 (out of 3 total possible) points.
* In the second 24 hour period following the due date, this lab will be penalized 1.2 points meaning the grading starts at 1.8 (out of 2 total possible) points.
* After 48 hours, the assignment will not be graded and thus earns no points, i.e., 0 out of 5 possible points.
